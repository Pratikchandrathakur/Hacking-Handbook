## Introduction

Hacking isn't just about breaking into systems; it's about understanding them deeply. Our goal here is to demystify the art of ethical hacking, emphasizing responsible and legal practices.

## Getting Started

Before you dive into the tools and techniques, make sure you have:

- A Kali Linux distribution (or similar)
- Basic command-line skills
- A hunger for knowledge (and maybe some coffee â˜•)
